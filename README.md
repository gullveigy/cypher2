# Assignment 1 - API testing and Source Control.

GitHub repository: https://github.com/gullveigy/MyAccountingAPItestings.git.

## Overview.

This is an online accounting web app, and there are three models for the time being（users,expenditures and incomes models）.Each model corresponds to a file in routes.
Users model has the following properties: username(unique)/password/profile(has 3 nested properties:gender/email/phone);
Expenditures model has the following properties:username(unique)/date/payment/amount/description;
Incomes model has the following properties:username(unique)/date/incomingmode/amount/description;
Each file in routes includes some basic CRUD operations and fuzzy search, etc.

## Data storage.

My tests included the integration of MongoDB.(db name:"gullin",it has 3 collections:expendituredb/incomedb/userdb)

1. expendituredb:
    
    1) database schema
        let ExpenditureSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
            username:String,
            date: String,
            payment:String,
            amount: Number,
            description:  {type: String, default:null}
        },
        { collection: 'expendituredb' });
    2) json document structure example
        {
          "_id": {
           "$oid": "5bdd7ec0ef72153750b2df72"
        },
          "description": "Latte",
          "username": "gullveig",
          "date": "2018-10-15",
          "payment": "Alipay",
          "amount": 4,
          "__v": 0
        }

2. incomedb:

    1) database schema
        let IncomeSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
            username:String,
            date: String,
            incomingmode:String,
            amount: Number,
            description:  {type: String, default:null}
        },
        { collection: 'incomedb' });
    2) json document structure example
        {
          "_id": {
            "$oid": "5bda4402467b3521a4b4a3a9"
        },
          "description": "benefits",
          "username": "gullveig",
          "date": "2018-10-01",
          "incomingmode": "Alipay",
          "amount": 78,
          "__v": 0
        }

3. userdb:

    1) database schema
        let UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
            username: { type:String, unique:true, required: true, writable: false},
            password: { type:String, unique:true, required: true, writable: false,},
            profile:{ gender: String,
                      email: String,
                      phone: String
         },
        },
        { collection: 'userdb' });
    2) json document structure example
        {
          "_id": {
             "$oid": "5bda48a9467b3521a4b4a3b5"

## Extra features.
1. GitHub repository: https://github.com/gullveigy/MyAccountingAPItestings.git.
2. Before writing test code, I connected the node server to a background database dedicated to testing,so my test code runs on the basis of the test database, and it would not cause any changes to the original database.
3. I implemented test-isolation,so each test file could be repeatedly run as a whole.
4. I have committed the put operation test in income-test.js as a work unit ,because at that time I implemented the test in two steps and commit 2 messages on that branch.
5. I have rolled back the code several times to a previous version(git reset --hard ........).
